This document contains additional points or explanations to the rules from README.md.


# 2. General principles

c- Not letting a player who is likely to break the GTP a chance to do so is good form and MUST/SHOULD be done. Ex: someone who is likely to clue a card that is already clued in their hand. 


# 3. Play order

d- This allow other players to clue subsequent cards with play hints.
 * If a card is filled-in and is revealed playable while the owner still had play-hints to resolve, the owner MUST interrupt the sequence of play-hints to play the revealed card. Indeed, the next play-hint may require this revealed card to be played first. 
 * If the other players do not want the play order to be changed, they should delay revealing the card to its owner. 


# 4. Play hints

b- Exception can be made at the end, when all playable cards are visible and the players know it cannot be a play hint - we can rely on the fact that "filled-in" playable cards must be played before play hints.
 
d- Suggestion: the slot of every previously unclued card that was touched by the clue. If every card was already clued, then every affected card. 

e- After witnessing a play-hint, every player (except the one giving the play-hint) MUST make a note of it. If a player observes that no other player has a playable card in this slot, it means they have the playable cards. They write down a play-hint on this card. Otherwise, they MUST still make a note.

Indeed, if a player with a playable card in this slot does not play this card when he had to, it means that they, too, have a playable card. They MUST then add a play-hint to their card. 

g- Any ordering convention is acceptable provided it is agreed upon beforehand. 
 * If this is not the correct order, a fix clue must be used (see "Fix clue".)


# 5. Trash clue

 * A "1" trash clue may fill in cards and reveal them playable - but it is STILL a trash clue. 
 * It is reasonable to give such a "trash clue" even when there are relevant things to do - so such a trash clue should not be interpreted as a stall.

c- Ex: Filling in a clued card that could (by GTP) be valuable, and revealing that it is not. This is a trash clue.
 ** ?? If the card is not yet played, if the other copy is marked and in another player’s hand, it is a trash clue, and a "gentleman discard" is allowed. ??
 * Ex: Every 2 is played. Alice clues 2. This is a trash clue. 
 * Ex: Every 2 but the blue one is played. Alice clues 2 on a previously unclued card. This is NOT a trash clue, and in fact, it reveals that the clued 2 is the b2. To everyone else, it is a play-hint on b2, and only on b2. If there is another playable card in the b2 slot, the holder of the clued b2 MAY let the clue tick. 
 * It is not a good idea to give a trash clue that will not be interpreted as a trash clue by the clue receiver, and then to fix it. Indeed, it may be interpreted as a play clue, then a fix clue: they will play the other cards. It is also very clue-consuming. 

e- A "1" trash clue may fill in cards and reveal them playable - but it is STILL a trash clue. 
 * It is reasonable to give such a "trash clue" even when there are relevant things to do - so such a trash clue should not be interpreted as a stall.


# 6. Fix clue

When a mistake is about to be made, we allow a clue that "fixes" it - and only does that. 

a- A fix clue may reveal to the card owner that the card is unplayable. This is recommended, but not necessary.
 - Indeed, the only other explanation is that there are two playable cards in this slot. If that is the case, then the card owner will see at least one playable card in this slot. If there is none, they will conclude without a doubt that it is a fix clue. If there is one, the situation is ambiguous; the card owner should err on the side of caution and delay playing their card. 
 - In the latter case, and if it is not immediately clear to its owner that the "fixed" card is unplayable, the other players MUST recognize the reason for the delay, and note that they have a playable card in the slot that was about to be played. If the clue was indeed a fix, then they MUST NOT play before the "fixed" player’s turn. If the clue was not a fix but a legitimate double play hint, at least one of them MUST play before the "fixed" player’s turn (bypassing their own queue if needed - no "letting the hint tick", see Strategies) to let the delaying player’s play queue resume as soon as possible. 

b- A possible fix clue that reveals trash cards MUST be considered as a fix clue before being considered a trash clue; as such, it is allowed to touch a mix of trash and valuable cards. 
 * In this case, a "1" clue will be considered a fix clue before being considered a trash clue. 

 * In the example, if Bob did not know that his slot 1 card is unplayable, he should attempt to play it. Doing so will tell Cathy that her slot 1 card is unplayable (she will already know it by looking at Bob’s hand).


e- What is important in determining whether a clue is a fix clue or not is whether the clue giver meant it as a fix clue or not. 
 * Normally (see 6d) everyone should be on the same page. But mistakes happen. 
 * Caution should be exerted in case of a potential erroneous fix clue. 
 * To avoid such ambiguous cases, clues that are not fix clues SHOULD NOT touch cards that are about to be played. 

?? Allow other fix moves ??
?? It is not a good idea to allow "stomping" on a clue to be a fix clue, since it could be interpreted as a finesse. ??
