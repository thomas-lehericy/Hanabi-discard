# No clue in the bank

a- If Alice has no play-hinted card and no remaining clue. She thus MUST discard. 
 * If she has a known trash card, she MAY discard it. This will be interpreted as a trash discard, that does not give any information.
 * If she has a known trash card, she MAY discard another, non-known trash card. This will be interpreted as a play hint.
 * ?? If she has NO known trash card, she MUST discard her card that is most likely to be trash, or a card decided through a known procedure - other players should have had the opportunity to save said card beforehand. This MUST NOT be interpreted as a play hint. (The players should do their best to avoid this situation.)

b- Players who anticipate this behavior and notice that it will lead to the discard of a CRITICAL card MUST prevent this situation from happening, by trash discards or other means. 


# There are no playable cards

We do not want to keep giving trash clues: this would exhaust the clue bank without bringing in any new card. 
Trash discards SHOULD be preferred to trash clues when the game is poor in playable cards. 

?? Consider situations where no trash discard can be safely given ??



# Letting the hint tick

a- Alice gives a play-hint in slot x. Bob and Cathy both have a playable card in slot x.
- At Bob’s turn, Bob does not play his slot x card. 
- Cathy deduces that Bob sees another playable card in slot x. Since no other player except Bob has a playable card in slot x, she knows she is the one with it.
- She now has a card to play. But instead, she **lets the hint tick**, so that Bob is informed that he, too, has a playable card in slot x.
- During the next turn, both Bob and Cathy will play their slot x card.

b- This can be used to inform Alice that she has a playable card in slot x.

c- If more than two playable cards are in slot x, 
- the last player (before Alice) with a playable card will pass once to inform the others that they too have a playable card.
- the penultimate player with a playable card will pass twice,
- the player before him with a playable card will pass thrice,
- etc. 

d- This applies to ANY type of play-hint, be they vanilla (discard / clues) or indirect. 


# Letting someone else give a clue

Ex: Cathy has exactly one non-play-hinted playable card, which is in slot x. 
* If Bob has a valuable card in slot x, Alice SHOULD save it. Cathy would know she was play-hinted, and Bob’s card would be out of danger. 
* If Bob has a trash card in slot x, Alice SHOULD do something unrelated (possibly trash-cluing or trash-discarding). Bob, seeing that his slot x card was not saved, now knows that his slot x card is safe to discard. He MAY discard. 
* Bob should exercise his better judgment when doing so: it may be that Alice had something more urgent to do, e.g. a fix clue to give. In this case they should either give a play-hint without discarding, or let someone else give the play-hint.
* We generalize to the following heuristic: 

a- Giving a play-hint on a card SHOULD be left to the last player (before the card holder) that has trash in this slot. 


# Special trash

Ex: Cathy has exactly one non-play-hinted playable card, which is in slot x. Alice gives a trash clue. 
* Bob then knows for certain he has a trash card in slot x. This card is now a known trash card for everyone but Cathy. Since Cathy does not know that Bob knows it is a trash card, she would interpret a discard of this card as a play clue on her. 
* A very daring Bob could use this information asymetry to his advantage - since the players other than Cathy will not interpret a discard of this trash card as a play hint, he now has a play clue that ONLY affects Cathy, and may be subsequently used to trigger finesses. 
* Otherwise, it is often safer to discard the trash card immediately, especially if Cathy might discard the card in her slot x. 
* This "special trash" becomes a normal known trash once Cathy becomes certain that Bob knows it is trash. 
* If Bob decides not to discard the card, the other players MAY play-hint Cathy’s slot x (to allow Bob to keep his special trash) or, if they decide that Bob’s daring is too much, they MAY decide to let Bob give the clue anyway. They can also trash-clue Bob’s special trash card. 


# Finesses and bluffs

Note to H-group players: this is a poor man’s finesse, please look for better ones!

Finesses are tricky, since play hints will be interpreted as "there is a playable card in this slot". The player immediately after the finesse-giver, up to the player who is supposed to play into the finesse (included), MUST thus know that their card in the affected slot is unplayable. Once someone plays into a finesse, the meaning of the play hint will be made clear and any accidental play avoided. 

a- Simple finesse / bluff:
- Alice gives a play clue on slot x, where there is at least one valuable but unplayable card. 
- Bob’s card in slot x is known (by him) unplayable. 
- No one else has a playable card in slot x. 
- If Bob does nothing, the first person with a non-known-unplayable card will attempt to play it.
- But Alice would not play-hint a truly unplayable card. This means there is a card that must be played that will resolve the situation and make at least one card playable.
- Bob thus plays the card that is most likely to make one of the slot x cards playable (based on his clues; if there are no compatible clues, Bob plays his finesse position.)
- This card may or may not actually allow a card to be played. In any case, the other players should take note that a finesse has occured, and as such, that at least one of them has a valuable but not-yet-playable card. 
- If the newly placed card makes one of their card possibly playable (based on their clues), they MUST attempt to play it. (Finesse are to be considered before Bluffs.) This MAY trigger multiple bluffs (if a card is falsely playable, it means that someone has a playable card in a position to be played before the play-hinted card is played). 
- Note that, by seeing Bob react to the finesse, the clue-receiver should acknowledge that he received a clue on a, at this time, UNPLAYABLE card. If, at his turn, his card’s playability has not changed (based on the previous player’s reactions), he should not play it. If nothing tells him that the card is unplayable, he MUST attempt to play it. 

Finesses take precedence over EVERY OTHER ACTION (including plays), otherwise bad information may be transmitted. It is the finesse-starter’s responsibility to ensure that this will not harm the team.  

Ex: g3, p3, y2, b1 and r2 are placed. Alice play-hints slot x. Bob’s card in slot x is clued 5, Cathy’s is trash, and Donald’s card is clued 4. The target of the finesse is either Bob or Donald. 
- If Bob does nothing, Donald deduces that he has g4. But Bob plays his finesse card, which is r3. Donald then knows that he has neither g4 nor p4. 
- Cathy then plays her finesse card, and places y3. Donald deduces that his card is not r3 - otherwise, Cathy wouldn’t have played. 
- It is now Donald’s turn. He may have b4 (unplayable) or y4 (playable). If he had b4, Cathy would have known that she couldn’t make the card playable, and would thus have fix-clued him. His card is thus y4. Donald plays it. (In any case, if there is a possibility that the card is playable, Donald MUST play it.) 
- Note that Bob HAS to play his finesse card, even though he can see that Cathy has the card that is ACTUALLY required for the finesse. Indeed, if Bob did not play, Cathy would NOT know that this was a finesse, and she would instead try to play her slot x card. 
- If Cathy had played b2 instead, Donald still deduces that his card is y4, and he would see that y4 is not yet playable. He thus does not play it. 
- If Bob had played g4 and Cathy had done nothing, Donald would have deduced that the finesse card had been made playable, and is thus Bob’s 5 and not his 4. (It should be clear to him anyway since he sees Bob’s card, and knows that it is playable.)

b- Simple self-finesse: If all cards in slot x (besides Bob) are trash, then Bob knows that he is the only possible target of the finesse. He must proceed as above.
